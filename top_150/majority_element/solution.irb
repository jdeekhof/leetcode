# Solution 1
def majority_element(nums)
    hash = {}
    nums.each do |num|
        hash[num] = (hash[num] || 0) + 1
    end
    return  hash.max_by{|k,v| v}.first
end

Memory 212.50MB Beats 80.60% of users with Ruby
## Notes
It works but runtime is really average. I am going to optimize it a little
